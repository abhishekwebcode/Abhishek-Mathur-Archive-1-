				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Singapore-based music technology manufacturer to debut groundbreaking precision-tuned in-ear monitor systems</p>
<p>LONDON —July 17, 2018— Technology innovator Stealth Sonics (www.stealthsonics.com) today announced the UK launch of its precision-tuned universal and custom in-ear monitor systems, to be unveiled at CanJam London, the world’s premier headphone audio show at Park Plaza Westminster Bridge. From July 21-22, 2018 in booths #45 &#038; 46, attendees can pick up a set of Stealth Sonics universal in-ear monitors at the show. Stealth&#8217;s audiologist will be on hand to provide free ear impressions for unique custom-fit in-ear monitors that will then be hand-crafted and delivered after the show.</p>
<p>  ￼  At CanJam, Stealth Sonics will debut a series of three systems, each available in both universal-fit options and custom-molded versions that take advantage of second-bend impressions to conform precisely to the inner ear canal, for superior fidelity, minimal acoustic interference and perfect fit:</p>
<p>  U2 &#038; C2: A two-driver hybrid design for a warm, smooth, musical sound.  <br />
U4 &#038; C4: A four-driver, pure balanced armature (BA) design for punchy bass, silky midrange and crystal-clear highs.<br />
  U9 &#038; C9: Flagship nine-driver, hybrid high-performance design featuring a precision-calibrated, large-diameter dynamic driver together with Super-High drivers, for extreme detail, precision and clarity.</p>
<p>Stealth Sonics leverages its innovations in the aerospace, medical, music, and acoustic fields to craft in-ear monitors that are as unique as each person—from custom precision-tuned systems to personalized finishes. Audiophiles and music professionals enjoy the utmost sonic accuracy and advanced hearing protection, in total style and comfort.  </p>
<p>What’s different about Stealth Sonics is its design philosophy which employs the scientific approach to couple a person’s natural hearing system with advancements in acoustic and audiological technologies.  “Nature has already blessed us with a marvelous in-built audio system,” says Davwinder Sheena, co-founder of Stealth Sonics. “We’re merely ensuring the precision and quality of the playback, utilizing the attributes of the natural system and providing versatility for use in many aspects of life. They can be used while working in the studio, performing on stage, listening while relaxing exercising, traveling and generally moving through everyday life.”</p>
<p>  All universal-fit in-ear monitors come with the Khameleon Skinz®, the world’s first interchangeable screw-on faceplate accessory that incorporates Stealth Damping® technology. Other available accessories include an array of eartips in various sizes and styles, and detachable silver-wire, copper-wire, lightning, USB-C and Bluetooth cables tailor the sonic experience to the user’s lifestyle.  </p>
<p>“The sound fundamentals of acoustic engineering and audiology have proven that our process allows your Custom IEMs to conform precisely to your inner ear canal,” states Balvinder Singh, co-founder of Stealth Sonics. “This provides unparalleled isolation (up to -36dB), superior fidelity, minimal acoustic interference and a perfect fit.”  For the ultimate in personalization, customers can choose from dozens of colors and accessories, and even feature your custom artwork to express your unique style or brand. All Custom IEMs feature either a dual or triple-bore sound aperture. Stealth Sonics finishes are highly-polished, seamless unibody designs. All Custom IEMs come with a 30-day refit policy.</p>
